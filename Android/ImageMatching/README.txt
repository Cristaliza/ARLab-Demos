========================================
   What is the Image Matching engine?
========================================

A real time image recognition engine may match thousands of pictures within your device without Internet connection.

Our image matcher uses the powerful smartphones hardware to complete the image processing and give matched results in milliseconds.

The engine is very easy to use. You just need to add your images and the engine will start doing the matching with no pre-processing required.
